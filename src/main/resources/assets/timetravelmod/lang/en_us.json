    "gui.tmengineerbook.tmsintroduction": "To travel to other Time Lines you will need a Time Machine. A Time Machine is an structure that you will build in the world and it has 4 block types: basic blocks (the base structure), core blocks (the engine of the Time Machine), upgrade blocks (these modify the Time Machine behaviour) and a control panel. A Time Machine may have more than one valid block for any of the previous categories. The Time Machine defines where has to be placed every block, with the special case of the Time Machine Upgrades, that replace the basic blocks and aren't mandatory. When you've built your Time Machine, go inside it and right click the control panel. A menu will allow you to select your destination Time Line. The available Time Lines will depend on the Time Machine tier. Select one and you will do your first Time Travel. For a brief moment, you won't be able to use the Time Machine again, because the engine has to cool down. If you break the engine while it's cooling down, you will die from a Temporal Explosion, that leaves a time hole. Temporal Explosions also randomly happen when using the Time Machine, but this has a really low chance.",
